The insertionSort function sorts an array using the Insertion Sort algorithm.
It takes two arguments - an array and its size. It starts by assuming the first element of the array is already sorted.
Then, it takes each element from the unsorted part of the array and compares it with the elements in the sorted part. 
If it finds an element that is smaller than the current element, it shifts all the elements to the right of that element.
Finally, it places the current element in the correct position.
The printArray function is used to print the sorted array.
The time complexity of Insertion Sort is O(n^2) in the worst case and O(n) in the best case, and its space complexity is O(1).
